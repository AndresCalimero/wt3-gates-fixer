# WT3 Gates Fixer

WT3 Gates Fixer is a little tool made with JavaFX to fix the position of the gates in the ground routes generated by World Traffic 3.

Sometimes WT3 fails to calculate the position of some gates making the plane badly positioned in a way that it may even get through airport objects, for this reason I created this small tool capable of changing the position of all the gates of the auto generated ground routes of an airport, to archieve this the tool reads the earth.wed.xml file of the selected airport to obtains all the relevant information.

The tool has been tested with the [LEMD airport (Madrid)](https://forums.x-plane.org/index.php?/files/file/38391-lemd-adolfo-su%C3%A1rez-madrid-barajas/) created by Pedro Escartin.

It is worth mentioning that it only works for downloaded airports, not for the default ones.

## Instructions

Using the tool is very simple, you only need to have a [Java VM](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jre10-downloads-4417026.html) 9+ installed on your computer and download the executable jar from [here](https://github.com/AndresCalimero/wt3-gates-fixer/releases/latest)

I made a very simple UI, first you need to set the X-Plane 11 installation directory:
![UI1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AndresCalimero/wt3-gates-fixer/master/images/ui1.png "X-Plane 11 installation directory")

Then you need to click "Load" to search for all the installed airports:
![UI2](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AndresCalimero/wt3-gates-fixer/master/images/ui2.png "Search for all the installed airports")

Finally you must click "Fix gates" and wait, it should only take a few seconds.

You can also build it with Gradle.
